# Assigment 1 - The komputer store

---

This first assignment was to be made entirely in vanilla JavaScript. The commits for this part of the repo suck as i did all the work and just pushed the final product in one commit.

To run this locally from Visual Studio code you need the live server extension:

And then right click the index.html to run the website:

You should then be greeted by something like this:

That's it i think. Have fun!
